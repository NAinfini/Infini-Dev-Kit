# Knowledge Base

## Concrete rules (DO NOT MODIFY)
- Rules in this document must be followed
- DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION
- Start every response with `主人`
- End every response with `好了喵`
- Use skills and MCP for each task; when a skill is missing, use `find-skills` and install what is needed.

## Purpose
- Keep this file as reusable engineering guidance, not a changelog.
- Capture durable patterns that prevent regressions.
- Prefer concise rules over historical narration.

## Maintenance Rules
- Record bugfixes as `issue`, `cause`, and `fix pattern`.
- For non-bug work, record only reusable implementation patterns.
- Merge overlapping entries into one canonical rule.
- Remove stale snapshots, completion counters, and temporary status text.
- Before each response, write new knowledge into the knowledge base file.
- For all edits made in the code, edit comment to explain what code does, where every piece of code leads to.
- If there are markdown files in the path of code execution, read through the files first before making changes, the files doesnt have to be directly in the same folder with the actual codes.

## Workflow Discipline

### Scope and Discovery
- Pin scope before implementation.
- Ask targeted questions when intent is ambiguous.
- For cross-page issues, inspect shared components, theme runtime, and state layers first.

### Obsolescence Lifecycle
- First pass: deprecate and document with evidence; do not delete unless clearly generated output.
- Evidence must include at least one of: no imports/usages, not referenced by routes/entrypoints, replaced by explicit path.
- Remove only after verification and migration path confirmation.

### Verification Discipline
- Prefer targeted tests for touched behavior, then run broader regressions.
- For migration phases, run this sequence before claiming completion:
  1. Feature-targeted tests
  2. Week/phase sweep tests
  3. Lint
  4. Build
  5. Typecheck
- If baseline debt blocks typecheck, report it explicitly with representative errors and keep claim scope narrow.

### Encoding and Localization Integrity
- Keep instruction and locale files UTF-8 clean.
- Re-read key lines after edits to catch mojibake early.
- Ensure touched keys exist in both `en` and `zh`.
- Replace hardcoded user-visible strings with `t(...)` keys.

## Frontend Architecture Patterns

### Token and Primitive-First Strategy
- Use runtime tokens (`--sys-*`, `--cmp-*`) as styling source of truth.
- Apply token usage at primitive/component layer so feature screens inherit consistency.
- Avoid hardcoded palette classes in features.

### Component Migration and Compatibility
- Migrate large pages in phases behind stable interfaces.
- Keep wrapper compatibility during migration (legacy import paths and props) until all callers are updated.
- Add stable `data-testid` hooks for newly split components to preserve testability during refactors.
- Keep frontend architecture primitives-first: no direct legacy vendor UI imports and no legacy bridge namespace usage in app surfaces.

### Layout and Dense Data UI
- Participant/member cards must preserve strict hierarchy: `name -> metadata -> actions`.
- Reserve action space in dense grids so destructive/action icons do not overlap metadata.
- Prefer stepped responsive columns (`1/2/3/4/5`) with consistent card height for stable layout.

### Event Page Patterns
- Keep `EventDetails` isolated from action controls to simplify rendering and testing.
- For participant overflow, use explicit `limit`, overflow card (`+N`), and reversible expand/collapse.
- `InviteMemberDialog` should support existing-member add flow, email invite flow, and explicit success/error feedback.

### Virtualization and Performance
- Gate virtualization by explicit threshold and keep non-virtual path for small lists.
- Use prefetch-on-hover for detail-heavy cards where query reuse is likely.
- Track bundle warnings and split heavy features incrementally instead of broad rewrites.

### Motion and Accessibility
- Respect reduced motion for CSS and JS animation paths.
- Keep one transform owner per interactive state to avoid stacked motion artifacts.
- Treat flicker, shake, and heavy glitch as optional FX; disable in reduced mode.

## Data and Contract Reliability
- Audit backend routes, shared contracts, and frontend usage together.
- For endpoint changes, update shared `ENDPOINTS` and worker route mapping in the same change.
- Normalize date/time at mapping boundaries.
- Gate privileged actions at render level, not icon/state only.

## Testing and QA Patterns
- Keep assertions behavior-focused and deterministic.
- Add dedicated tests for newly extracted UI contracts (component-level test IDs and interactions).
- For invite flows, test invalid input, valid input, and mutation path in the same suite.
- Keep checklist progress in plan docs tied to executed command evidence.

## Issue, Cause, Fix Patterns

### Theme and Styling
- **issue**: Theme-scoped control signature tests missed expected markers on first interaction.
  **cause**: active theme was resolved from document scope before mounted node scope was available.
  **fix pattern**: initialize from document theme, then re-resolve in `useLayoutEffect` using `closest('[data-theme]')` with forwarded ref synchronization.

- **issue**: Theme preference sync produced repeated `404` noise and retry churn.
  **cause**: frontend expected `/auth/preferences` before backend capability was deployed.
  **fix pattern**: treat `404` as optional capability absence, disable remote sync for that session, continue local-state behavior.

- **issue**: AntD feedback APIs (`message`, `notification`, modal APIs) were used without stable app context.
  **cause**: provider stack wrapped `ConfigProvider` only, so feedback access depended on static APIs or ad-hoc context assumptions.
  **fix pattern**: always wrap `ConfigProvider` with AntD `<App>` and expose a single `useKitApp()` hook from the kit provider boundary.

- **issue**: Theme compilation could not be run as a deterministic workflow artifact.
  **cause**: compile entrypoint was missing and validation logic had no report-first path.
  **fix pattern**: add a deterministic `compileAll` script that emits theme artifacts and validation reports; gate hard failures behind explicit strict validation mode.

### Accessibility
- **issue**: Accessibility audit parsing failed even when Lighthouse JSON file was valid.
  **cause**: PowerShell `ConvertFrom-Json` was brittle on large report payloads and special characters.
  **fix pattern**: use Node `JSON.parse` for Lighthouse report parsing and summary generation; keep PowerShell for orchestration only.

- **issue**: Accessibility regressions appeared from shimmed controls with downgraded DOM semantics.
  **cause**: generic MUI subpath shim rendered many components as `div`, so control ARIA/state props were attached to non-interactive elements.
  **fix pattern**: implement semantic subpath shims for interactive controls (`button`, `input`, `range`) and add subpath-level contract tests for role/ARIA behavior.

- **issue**: Form-related accessibility checks failed on date, range, and select controls.
  **cause**: controls relied on visual context but lacked explicit accessible names in DOM.
  **fix pattern**: require explicit `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` for non-textual or unlabeled controls, sourced from i18n keys to preserve localization parity.

- **issue**: Icon-only controls regressed accessibility semantics during UI refactors.
  **cause**: tooltip text and visual context were present, but buttons themselves lacked stable accessible names.
  **fix pattern**: for every icon-only control, define explicit `aria-label` from existing i18n keys (or item-aware labels when dynamic), then lock contracts with source assertions on critical pages.

### Error Handling and Recovery
- **issue**: GuildWar active team management had no recoverable UI when team query failed.
  **cause**: `ActiveWarManagement` handled loading/no-war branches but omitted `useWarTeams` error-state branching.
  **fix pattern**: for query-driven pages, add explicit error-state + retry (`refetch`) path with stable `data-testid` hooks and lock it with contract tests.

- **issue**: War history views lost recovery affordances when list queries failed or filters zeroed results.
  **cause**: history page only handled loading and plain no-results text, without explicit query-error actions or empty-state CTA hooks.
  **fix pattern**: in list-driven pages, keep filter controls visible, add dedicated query-error branch (`error-state` + retry), and add filtered-empty action hooks (`clear_filters`) guarded by active-filter detection.

- **issue**: Dashboard can appear blank when multiple independent summary queries fail at once.
  **cause**: page composed several query-backed sections but had no page-level recovery branch when all data slices were empty due to failures.
  **fix pattern**: in aggregate pages, gate a page-level recoverable error state on `hasAnyQueryError && !hasAnyData`, and wire one retry action to fan out all relevant `refetch` calls.

### Migration and Compatibility
- **issue**: Large import-path codemods can silently corrupt non-ASCII literals or break syntax.
  **cause**: bulk text replacement was performed without strict UTF-8 write guarantees and without immediate syntax verification.
  **fix pattern**: for mass codemods, force UTF-8 writes explicitly, then run a fast syntax gate (`tsc --noEmit` or targeted parse checks) before continuing structural changes.

- **issue**: Workspace-scoped test execution produced widespread `ENOENT` in source-contract tests.
  **cause**: tests resolved files with `resolve(process.cwd(), 'apps/portal/...')`, which duplicates path segments when cwd is already `apps/portal`.
  **fix pattern**: use cwd-agnostic source locators (repo-root detection helper or normalized relative resolver) for file-read contract tests.

- **issue**: Portal typecheck command paths diverged between root and workspace executions.
  **cause**: root gate (`config/typescript/tsconfig.portal.json`) and workspace-local `apps/portal/tsconfig.json` had different include/exclude behavior.
  **fix pattern**: keep portal compile gate on shared config, explicitly include locale JSON in workspace tsconfig, and scope Playwright `*.spec.*` files out of portal compile typecheck when they are runtime-only E2E suites.

- **issue**: Legacy bridge subpath imports can pass typecheck but fail at build time after bulk codemods.
  **cause**: bridge subpath imports depended on alias behavior that was not consistently configured across Vite/Vitest/TypeScript resolution.
  **fix pattern**: keep resolver parity for bridge subpaths across `vite`, `vitest`, root compile tsconfig, and workspace tsconfig; prefer explicit prefix mappings and verify with contract tests + typecheck + build in the same batch.

- **issue**: API migrations can stall when shared package removal happens before callsites move to new imports.
  **cause**: portal API modules still depended on `@guild/api-client` and `@guild/shared-api/*`, forcing temporary shim declarations that erased type safety.
  **fix pattern**: migrate compatibility surfaces into the target package first (endpoint map, HTTP client, DTO types), then switch callsites and delete shims in the same verification batch (`typecheck` + `build`).

- **issue**: Removing legacy app folders can break builds even when TypeScript passes.
  **cause**: stylesheet entrypoints may still use relative `@import` paths to deleted locations, while TS alias migration only covers module imports.
  **fix pattern**: when relocating folders, update TS/Vite/Vitest path aliases and separately audit CSS `@import` paths; verify with both `typecheck` and production `build`.

### Icon and Component Migration
- **issue**: Direct icon migrations from MUI-shaped APIs to `lucide-react` can cause wide churn when existing callsites rely on `sx` props.
  **cause**: page-level icon usage was built around MUI-style icon props (`sx`, class merges), while lucide icons use plain SVG props.
  **fix pattern**: during phased page migration, use a local adapter that maps a minimal `sx` subset (`fontSize`, spacing, color/opacity) to SVG `style`, migrate imports first under contract tests, then remove adapter when full primitive conversion is complete.

- **issue**: Migrated icon files can become harder to read when every icon import is aliased even when no collision exists.
  **cause**: transitional adapter patterns were applied broadly, including callsites where direct names are already unambiguous.
  **fix pattern**: keep aliasing only where adapter/source symbol separation is required; add a cleanup checklist task to normalize direct imports once adapters are removed.

- **issue**: Lucide optimization work can regress later when namespace/default/dynamic imports are reintroduced in feature files.
  **cause**: icon cleanup was enforced by convention only, without a lasting source-contract gate for high-cost import patterns.
  **fix pattern**: add a phase-level contract that audits target files and blocks `import * as`, default imports, and `lucide-react/dynamic` entrypoints.

### Bundle Optimization and Lazy Loading
- **issue**: Lazy-loading UI subcomponents did not reduce initial bundle cost when the lazy component was always mounted with `open={false}`.
  **cause**: `React.lazy` import still resolves on first render if the component is present in the tree, even when dialog visibility is closed.
  **fix pattern**: combine lazy import with conditional mount gate (`isOpen ? <Suspense><LazyDialog open={isOpen} ... /></Suspense> : null`) so code is fetched only when the user opens the surface.

- **issue**: Extracting a dialog for bundle splitting can fail to reduce initial payload if the lazy component remains permanently mounted.
  **cause**: parent render keeps the lazy component in-tree even while closed, triggering eager load during first render.
  **fix pattern**: pair `lazy(() => import(...))` with an explicit open-state conditional mount and `Suspense` wrapper so the chunk is requested only when the dialog opens.

- **issue**: Pages with multiple related confirmation dialogs can retain initial bundle weight even after single-dialog extraction.
  **cause**: each inline confirmation dialog stays in the feature entry chunk when kept directly in the page component.
  **fix pattern**: extract related confirmations into one lazy-loaded dialog group component and gate it with one boolean (`hasAnyDialogOpen`) so none of the confirmation UI is downloaded until first open.

- **issue**: Bundle-splitting tasks can be reported as complete without proving an actual chunk was emitted.
  **cause**: config-only changes (`manualChunks`) were applied without build-output evidence.
  **fix pattern**: pair each chunking config change with a source-contract test and a build verification that names the emitted chunk artifact (e.g., `guild-war-*.js`).

### Image and Media Optimization
- **issue**: Image-heavy pages can keep Lighthouse warnings when responsive visuals lack intrinsic sizing metadata.
  **cause**: `<img>` nodes inside cards/modals/avatars relied on CSS dimensions only, so browser layout reservation and decode scheduling were suboptimal.
  **fix pattern**: add explicit `width`/`height` plus `loading`/`decoding` (and `fetchPriority` for opened hero media), then lock with source-contract tests to prevent regressions.

### QA and Testing
- **issue**: Feature tests with mocked `useTranslation` can fail on unrelated code paths when components read `i18n.language`.
  **cause**: mock returned `t` only, while runtime hook contract includes both translator and i18n instance.
  **fix pattern**: when mocking `useTranslation`, provide minimal `i18n` parity (`{ language: 'en' }`) in addition to `t` to keep tests stable during localization-aware refactors.

- **issue**: Moving inline dialogs to lazy-loaded components can break existing interaction tests that assume synchronous mount.
  **cause**: `React.lazy` resolves asynchronously, so `getBy*` assertions run before the dialog subtree is available.
  **fix pattern**: for lazy dialog migrations, keep source-contract coverage in the parent file and update interaction tests to await mount (`findBy*`) after the open action.

- **issue**: Browser/mobile QA checklist completion drifted when verification was done ad-hoc.
  **cause**: cross-browser and mobile checks lacked one deterministic script producing both visual and runtime evidence.
  **fix pattern**: keep one scripted matrix that runs desktop/mobile screenshot sweeps and runtime console/network audits, then writes JSON/Markdown artifacts under a fixed report path.

## Portable Rules
1. Prefer token-driven styling over hardcoded palette utilities.
2. Keep hooks unconditional and in stable render order.
3. Use phased migrations with explicit verification gates.
4. Keep shared imports package-based instead of deep relative paths.
5. Record prevention patterns, not work logs.
6. Derive next priorities from unchecked plan items first.
